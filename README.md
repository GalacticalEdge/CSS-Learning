# CSS-Learning
A repository to show how much I'm learning with CSS

# How to use this
Make sure you download 'CSS HTML Learning.html' and '
CSS Learning.css ', then once you've downloaded them, launch the 'HTML Learning.html' file

# Notes
The background image in the CSS file may not work properly on your computer since the directory on your computer may not be the same as mine.

However, I might work on a way to make the file render properly on all systems provided they download a .jpg file in this repository as well.

Also note that the navigation bar at the top of the page doesn't actually work as of right now. The reason for this is because I have not created specific pages for them as of yet. Even if I do and publish them in this repository, you will need to change the 'href' directory to match the directory that you've saved the files on your computer.
