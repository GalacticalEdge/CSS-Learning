# CSS-Learning
A repository to show how much I'm learning with CSS

# How to use this
Make sure you download 'CSS HTML Learning.html' and '
CSS Learning.css ', then once you've downloaded them, launch the 'HTML Learning.html' file

# Notes
The background image in the CSS file may not work properly on your computer since the directory on your computer may not be the same as mine.

However, I might work on a way to make the file render properly on all systems provided they download a folder in this repository as well.
